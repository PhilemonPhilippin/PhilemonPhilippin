Hello there ðŸ˜„

My name is PhilÃ©mon, i discovered programming in 2017 but started to learn it more seriously from end of 2021.

I just finished a bootcamp in .Net Web development, and i am currently looking for a job or an internship.

If you want to see my biggest project, you can look at my Bugtracker repositories.
This project is made in two parts : the API part and the Web Assembly part :
Bugtracker.API-repo & Bugtracker.WASM-repo

(Please be aware that the project is not 100% done ðŸ˜…)

I am glad that you found my Github page,

And wish you a wonderful day ðŸ˜ƒ
