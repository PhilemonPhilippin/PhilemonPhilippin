# About

Hello there üòÑ My name is **Phil√©mon**.

I studied **law** for 5 years, then I worked in social security law.

I discovered **programming** in 2017 and immediatly fell in love with it. I started to learn it more seriously from end of 2021.

I want to make better software so that every one has easier and more enjoyable access to technology.

The **languages and tools** I use are:

- [![C#](/csharp.png) _C#_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)>) [![Transact-SQL](/sql.png) _Transact-SQL_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL) [![GIT](/git.png) _GIT_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
- [![JavaScript](/js.png) _JavaScript_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) [![HTML](/html.png) _HTML 5_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) [![CSS](/css.png) _CSS 3_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
- [![Angular](/angular.png) _Angular_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)>) [![Blazor](/blazor.png) _Blazor_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazor) [![Bootstrap](/bootstrap.png) _Bootstrap_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)>)

My **work experience** includes 5 months of _job training_ and 6 months of _internship_ in a consulting firm.

My career goals are rooted in a passion for continuous learning and the pursuit of excellence in my work.

I aim to constantly expand my knowledge by adopting new languages, tools and methodologies, and by contributing to projects that have a positive impact.

At the moment, I'm keeping myself **busy by**

- Looking for a job as a Software Developer,
- Developing functionalities for the website of an non-profit association in the cultural sector,
- Studying programming in more detail via LeetCode as well as via small projects to practice the concepts I'm discovering,
- And studying Harvard CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Computer Science.

# Kitchen

I started creating a program to manage recipes: _Kitchen_. This projet isn't over yet.

It is composed of two parts: the server in **ASP.NET API** and the user interface in **Angular**.

The server uses **SQL Server** and **Entity Framework** for data access.

# Bug tracker

If you want to see my first relatively large project, you can look at my _Bugtracker_.
I built it in about a month during my .NET job training.

This project is made of two parts: the server in **ASP.NET API** and the user interface in **Blazor**.

The server uses **SQL Server** and **ADO.NET** for data access.
