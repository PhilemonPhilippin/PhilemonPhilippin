# Projects

## üë®‚Äçüç≥ InnoCheffing

InnoCheffing is a web application designed to help me invent recipes and prepare dishes based on them. The overall idea of the app is to make creating new recipes easy, interesting and fun.  
This project is still in its early stages. Details will come later as the application is built.
