        My name is PhilÃ©mon, I discovered programming in 2017 but started to
        learn it more seriously from end of 2021. <br />
        I am currently working as .NET Developer & Programer at Contraste
        Digital, in Belgium.

        If you want to see my biggest project, you can look at my Bugtracker.
        <br />This project is made of two parts : the Web Assembly part and the
        API part.
