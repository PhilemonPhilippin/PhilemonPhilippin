## 👤 About

Hello there 😄 My name is **Philémon**.

In 2021, I have decided to redirect my career towards software development to follow my passion.  
My career goals are rooted in a passion for continuous learning.

The **languages and tools** I use the most are :

![.NET](./dotnet.png ".NET") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![C#](./csharp.png "C#") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![SQL](./sql.png "SQL") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![Git](./git.png "Git") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![JavaScript](./js.png "JavaScript") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![TypeScript](./ts.png "TypeScript") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![Angular](./angular.png "Angular") &nbsp; &nbsp;

At the moment, I am keeping myself busy by

- Looking for a new opportunity as a Software Developer in Belgium in the surroundings of Brussels,
- Deepening my knowledge of software development by building projects and taking courses.

## 🏗️ Projects

To consolidate my skills in fullstack development, I created two CRUD applications.  
The first, Bugtracker, was built in about 1 month, in 2022, because it was my end-of-professional-training project.  
The second, Kitchen, was built in about 2 months in 2023.

| Project name  | Back end                                                                   | Front end                                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🍽️ Kitchen    | [Kitchen](https://github.com/PhilemonPhilippin/Kitchen-repo)               | [KitchenNG](https://github.com/PhilemonPhilippin/KitchenNG-repo)             |
| 🐞 Bugtracker | [Bugtracker.API](https://github.com/PhilemonPhilippin/Bugtracker.API-repo) | [Bugtracker.WASM](https://github.com/PhilemonPhilippin/Bugtracker.WASM-repo) |

I am taking a short break from creating simple CRUD applications because I want to work on projects that are a bit closer to my heart.
