# About

Hello there 😄 My name is **Philémon**.

I studied **law** for 5 years, then I worked in social security law.

I discovered **programming** in 2017 and immediatly fell in love with it. I started to learn it more seriously from end of 2021.

The _languages and tools_ I use are :

- [![C#](/csharp.png) _C#_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)>) [![Transact-SQL](/sql.png) _Transact-SQL_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL) [![GIT](/git.png) _GIT_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
- [![JavaScript](/js.png) _JavaScript_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) [![HTML](/html.png) _HTML 5_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) [![CSS](/css.png) _CSS 3_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
- [![Angular](/angular.png) _Angular_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)>) [![Blazor](/blazor.png) _Blazor_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazor) [![Bootstrap](/bootstrap.png) _Bootstrap_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)>)

My work experience includes 5 months of _bootcamp_ and 6 months of work at Contraste.

I am currently **looking for a job** as .NET Developer, in Belgium 😁

Moreover, I am currently learning Angular in order to use it in my current project: _Kitchen_

# Bug tracker

If you want to see my biggest project, you can look at my _Bugtracker_.

This project is made of two parts : the server in **ASP.NET API** and the user interface in **Blazor**.

The server uses **SQL Server** and **ADO.NET** for data access.

# Kitchen

I am currently creating a program to manage recipes: _Kitchen_.

It is composed of two parts : the server in **ASP.NET API** and the user interface in **Angular**.

The server uses **SQL Server** and **Entity Framework** for data access.
