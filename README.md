## 👤 About

Hello there 😄 My name is **Philémon**.

In 2021, I have decided to redirect my career towards software development to follow my passion.  
My career goals are rooted in a passion for continuous learning.

The **languages and tools** I use the most are :

![.NET](./dotnet.png ".NET") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![C#](./csharp.png "C#") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![SQL](./sql.png "SQL") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![Git](./git.png "Git") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![JavaScript](./js.png "JavaScript") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![TypeScript](./ts.png "TypeScript") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![Angular](./angular.png "Angular") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![HTML](./html.png "HTML") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![CSS](./css.png "CSS")

## 🏗️ Projects

To consolidate my skills in fullstack development, I created two web applications.  
The first, Bugtracker, was built in about 1 month, in 2022, because it was my end-of-professional-training project.  
The second, Kitchen, was built in about 2 months in 2023.
