# üë§ About

Hello there üòÑ My name is **Phil√©mon**.

In 2021, I have decided to redirect my career towards software development to follow my passion.

I have completed a 5-month **professional training** in .NET development, where I have acquired skills in back-end development.  
After this training, I had the opportunity to work for 6 months **on a real project** as a .NET Developer in a consulting firm.  
After this first experience, I was able to complete a **second professional training**, this time more focused on front-end development.

My career goals are rooted in a passion for continuous learning.

The **languages and tools** I use the most are :

![.NET](./dotnet.png ".NET") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![C#](./csharp.png "C#") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![SQL](./sql.png "SQL") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![Git](./git.png "Git") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![JavaScript](./js.png "JavaScript") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![TypeScript](./ts.png "TypeScript") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![Angular](./angular.png "Angular") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![HTML](./html.png "HTML") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![CSS](./css.png "CSS")

At the moment, I'm keeping myself busy by

- Looking for a new opportunity as a Software Developer in Belgium in the surroundings of Brussels,
- Deepening my knowledge of software development by building projects and taking courses.

## Projects

### üçΩÔ∏è Kitchen

I created a program to manage recipes : Kitchen.  
It is composed of two parts : the server in **ASP.NET API** and the user interface in **Angular**.

| Back end                                                     | Front end                                                        |

### üêû Bug tracker

If you want to see my first relatively large project, you can look at my Bugtracker.
I built it in about a month during my .NET job training.  
This project is made of two parts : the server in **ASP.NET API** and the user interface in **Blazor**.
