# üë§ About

Hello there üòÑ My name is **Phil√©mon**.

I studied **law** for 5 years, then I worked in social security law.

I discovered **programming** in 2017 and immediatly fell in love with it. I started to learn it more seriously from end of 2021.

I want to make better software so that every one has easier and more enjoyable access to technology.

The **languages and tools** I use are:

![C#](/csharp.png) &nbsp; ![Transact-SQL](/sql.png) &nbsp; ![GIT](/git.png) &nbsp; ![JavaScript](/js.png) &nbsp; ![HTML](/html.png) &nbsp; ![CSS](/css.png) &nbsp; ![Angular](/angular.png) &nbsp; ![Blazor](/blazor.png)

My **work experience** includes 5 months of _job training_ and 6 months of _internship_ in a consulting firm.

My career goals are rooted in a passion for continuous learning and the pursuit of excellence in my work.

At the moment, I'm keeping myself **busy by**

- Looking for a job as a Software Developer in Belgium,
- Developing functionalities for the website of an non-profit association in the cultural sector,
- Studying programming via LeetCode as well as via small projects to practice the concepts I'm discovering,
- And studying Harvard CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Computer Science.

# Projects
## üçΩÔ∏è Kitchen

I started creating a program to manage recipes: _Kitchen_. This projet isn't over yet.

It is composed of two parts: the server in **ASP.NET API** and the user interface in **Angular**.

The server uses **SQL Server** and **Entity Framework** for data access.

## üêû Bug tracker

If you want to see my first relatively large project, you can look at my _Bugtracker_.
I built it in about a month during my .NET job training.

This project is made of two parts: the server in **ASP.NET API** and the user interface in **Blazor**.

The server uses **SQL Server** and **ADO.NET** for data access.
