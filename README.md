# Bug tracker

If you want to see my biggest project, you can look at my Bugtracker. This project is made of two parts : the web assembly part and the API part.

🐞 **[Project - Bugtracker.WASM (Front)](https://github.com/Tarcacode/Bugtracker.WASM-repo)**

🐞 **[Project - Bugtracker.API (Back)](https://github.com/Tarcacode/Bugtracker.API-repo)**

# Kitchen

I am currently creating a program to manage recipes. It will be composed of

- a server part in ASP.NET API

- and later, a web user interface made in React.
