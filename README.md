# 👤 About

Hello there 😄 My name is **Philémon**.

I discovered **programming** in 2017 and immediatly fell in love with it. I started to learn it more seriously from end of 2021.

My **work experience** includes 6 months of work in a consulting firm as a .NET back-end developer.     
It also includes 5 months of professional training in .NET development, focusing on the web development fundamentals and going far enough into .NET back-end development.  
Finally, my work experience also includes 7 months of professional training in web development, focusing on the JavaScript ecosystem and front-end development.  

My career goals are rooted in a passion for continuous learning.

The **languages and tools** I use the most are :

![.NET](./dotnet.png ".NET") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![C#](./csharp.png "C#") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![SQL](./sql.png "SQL") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![Git](./git.png "Git") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![JavaScript](./js.png "JavaScript") &nbsp; &nbsp;

At the moment, I'm keeping myself busy by

- Working on my new project InnoCheffing, the more ambitious rewrite of my Kitchen web application,
- Developing functionalities for the Wix website of a non-profit association in the cultural sector ([Les Trouvères](https://www.lestrouveres.com/)),
- Studying for Harvard CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science certification (this is paused for the moment).
