**Hello there** ðŸ˜„

My name is PhilÃ©mon, I discovered programming in 2017 but started to learn it more seriously from end of 2021.

I am currently working as .NET Developer at Contraste Digital, in Belgium.

# Bug tracker

If you want to see my biggest project, you can look at my Bugtracker. This project is made of two parts : the web assembly part and the API part.

**[Project - Bugtracker.API (Back)](https://github.com/Tarcacode/Bugtracker.API-repo)**

# Chillify

I am currently working on a project called Chillify.

The idea is to make a big web application to learn and practice many concepts of Web development. Therefore, the project might seem like going in several directions at the same time.

It is intended, bear with me. I use it like a sandbox, but i try to give it a semblance of realism.

I am glad that you found my GitHub page and wish you a wonderful day ðŸ˜ƒ
