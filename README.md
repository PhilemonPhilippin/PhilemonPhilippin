# Projects
## üçΩÔ∏è Kitchen

I started creating a program to manage recipes : Kitchen.

It is composed of two parts : the server in **ASP.NET API** and the user interface in **Angular**.

The server uses **SQL Server** and **Entity Framework** for data access.

## üêû Bug tracker

If you want to see my first relatively large project, you can look at my Bugtracker.
I built it in about a month during my .NET job training.

This project is made of two parts : the server in **ASP.NET API** and the user interface in **Blazor**.

The server uses **SQL Server** and **ADO.NET** for data access.
