# About

Hello there 😄 My name is **Philémon**.

I studied **law** for 5 years, then I worked in social security law.

I discovered **programming** in 2017 and immediatly fell in love with it. I started to learn it more seriously from end of 2021.

The **languages and tools** i use are :

- [![C#](/csharp.png) _C#_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)>) [![Transact-SQL](/sql.png) _Transact-SQL_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL) [![GIT](/git.png) _GIT_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
