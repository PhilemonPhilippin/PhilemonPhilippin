Hello there ðŸ˜„

My name is PhilÃ©mon, I discovered programming in 2017 but started to learn it more seriously from end of 2021.

I am currently working as .NET Developer & Programer for Contraste Digital, in Belgium.

If you want to see my biggest project, you can look at my Bugtracker repositories.
This project is made of two parts : the API part and the Web Assembly part :
Bugtracker.API-repo & Bugtracker.WASM-repo

I am glad that you found my GitHub page,

And wish you a wonderful day ðŸ˜ƒ
