# üë§ About

Hello there üòÑ My name is **Phil√©mon**.

I discovered **programming** in 2017 and immediatly fell in love with it. I started to learn it more seriously from end of 2021.

My **work experience** includes 6 months of work in a consulting firm as a .NET back-end developer.  
It also includes 5 months of professional training in .NET development, focusing on the web development fundamentals and going far enough into .NET back-end development.  
Finally, my work experience also includes 7 months of professional training in web development, focusing on the JavaScript ecosystem and front-end development.

My career goals are rooted in a passion for continuous learning.

The **languages and tools** I use the most are :

![.NET](./dotnet.png ".NET") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![C#](./csharp.png "C#") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![SQL](./sql.png "SQL") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![Git](./git.png "Git") &nbsp; &nbsp;
![JavaScript](./js.png "JavaScript") &nbsp; &nbsp;

At the moment, I'm keeping myself busy by

- Looking for a new opportunity as a Junior .NET Junior Developer in Belgium, in the surroundings of Brussels,
- Exercising my algorithmic skills through code challenges and deepening my knowledge of C# and .NET trough small projects.
